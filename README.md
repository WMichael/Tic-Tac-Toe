# Tic-Tac-Toe
Java GUI implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe 

### What needs to be done: 
- When a square has been clicked on, remove the mouse listener for it untill the the next game. (When removing a mouse listener and adding it again, the counter for the number of tiles clicked is wrong and incremates differently at times.)
